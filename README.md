# trivial.js

## Summary

The idea of this framework-esc javascript library is so that frontend developers, creating static websites can simply import the library with a script tag:

```
<script src = 'https://hostingLink/trivial.js'></script>
```
This library gives the tools needed to create custom tags, which we call modules. 

## Usage

### The Basics

The constructor for the module is made up of **the tag name, the HTML, and the replacing variables** (see **module.replacingObjects**).
Every created module is class based, so one could make a template for a module like: 

```
class customMod extends module {
  constructor() {
    const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
      <(var)>
    </div>`;
    super('tagName', html, { var: "ecstatic" })
  }
}
```

The to implement the module, an instance of the class must be made. So for the custom moudle class defined:

```
let customTag = new customMod();
```

Then in order to initialize the module and make all changes to the DOM `module.init()` must be called:
```
customTag.init();
```

A custom module does not have to be defined through extending the class though 
```
const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
  <(superCoolVar)>
</div>`;
const customTag = new module('tagName', html, { var: "ecstatic" });
customTag.init();
```

The above yields the same results as creating the custom class.

### Replacing Variables

The HTML that is inputed into a module can have variables within the HTML. These can be defined in the third input to the module constructor. 
```
<describer></describer>

<script>
  const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
    I am <(adj)>
  </div>`;
  const customTag = new module('describer', html, { adj: "blue" });
  customTag.init();
</script>
```
So within the describer tag, the user will see **I am blue** rather than **I am <(adj)>**

#### Inherit Variables

The trivial library also comes with inherit variables. For now, there are three: 
* count 
* countFromOne
* innerHTML.

count and countFromOne are similar. Count returns which instance of a module it is. countFromOne does the same, but rather than starting from 0 it starts from 1

```
<describer></describer><br/>
<describer></describer><br/>
<describer></describer>

<script>
  const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
    I am number <(count)> and <(adj)>
  </div>`;
  const customTag = new module('describer', html, { adj: "blue" });
  customTag.init();
</script>
```
So the user will see: 
```
I am number 0 and blue
I am number 1 and blue
I am number 2 and blue
```

the innerHTML variable will be set equal to what was inside a custom tag **before** init() is called on the tag. After the first init() is called, the tag's inner HTML is set to null, and the innerHTML will be stored within a variable but not visible in the web page unless <(innerHTML)> is placed in the HTML:

```
<describer>one, da da da da da da dada. dadada da da da da I am number one!</describer>

<script>
  const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
    I am number <(innerHTML)>
  </div>`;
  const customTag = new module('describer', html, { adj: "blue" });
  customTag.init();
</script>
```
So the user will see: 
```
I am number one, da da da da da da dada. dadada da da da da I am number one!
```

### Replacing Variables with a Tag's Attributes

The HTML that is inputed into a module can also have variables within the HTML which correspond to a tag's attributes. The syntax looks like `<{attribute}>`
```
<describer description = 'this is a cool library'></describer>

<script>
  const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
    It's true that <{description}>
  </div>`;
  const customTag = new module('describer', html, {});
  customTag.init();
</script>
```
So within the describer tag, the user will see **It's true that this is a cool library** rather than **It's true that <{description}>**

### Shadow Root

trivial.js also comes with a convenient method to create a shadow root for each instance of the module.
```
const html = `<div class = 'superCool'>
  This will be a shadow root
</div>

<style>
div {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>`;
let customTag = new module('describer', html, {});
customTag.init();
customTag.shadowRoot = true;
```
In order to delete the shadow root, simply do `customTag.shadowRoot = false`

### Importing HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Simply call the function `setHTMLSource` with the url of the html as a parameter. Some servers and browsers automatically treat html files differently (i.e. they require the <html></html> tags and so on), so we recommend that the extention of the file is set to .triv (you know just to show the love)
```
let customTag = new module('describer', html, {});
customTag.init();
customTag.setHTMLSource('/myModHtml.triv');

```
myModHtml.triv may look something like this:
```
<div>
I am element number <(countFromOne)>. I know that this library is just the <{adj}>
</div>
<style>
  Some styling here
</style>
```

Loading CSS and Javascript are basically the same idea. For CSS just call the setCSSSource with the url as the parameter and with Javascript use the setJSSource, again with the URL as the parameter
